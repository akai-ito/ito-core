**The server behind Ito: the agent loop and the client API that Ari talks to.**

## What it will do

- Hold one continuous conversation with your agent and stream it live: replies as they are
  written, what the agent is doing right now, and a Stop that works instantly.
- Never lose a message: send while the agent is busy, pick up after any disconnect, and retry
  without duplicates.
- Publish its client API as a versioned spec, with API docs on GitHub Pages, so any client can be
  built against it.
- Run the agent on Codex behind a small interface of its own, with cloud or local models.
